      <h1>Security.</h1>

      <h2>Security ?</h2>

      <h3>Security :-(</h3>

      <p>Now you understand. Let’s go to security anonymous.</p>
      
      <p><a href="#groups">See if there’s one already where you live</a> at the bottom of the page, or start one by <a href="https://github.com/securityanonymous/whysecurity">forking the repository</a>, making your changes, and submitting a pull request.</p>

      <h4>The Plan</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>We go to a good pub or venue.</li>
        <li>We eat food, we drink (be it beer, cocktails or soft drinks).</li>
        <li>We say ‘security’.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This might be the group for you if you want to meet socially conscious hackers to talk about interesting things. This is not an entrepreneurial meetup, nor is it networking (though we recognize that that happens). It is a support group, a place to meet good people and talk about good and bad things.</p>

      <p>Although education and outreach are both important to us, the primary goal is to create a social group for people in and around security, from all backgrounds, where they feel comfortable and welcome.</p>

      <p>There aren’t regularly organized talks, workshops, or otherwise. We don’t have tickets, we don’t have namebadges. We’re striving to be as disorganised and informal as possible. We will talk security a lot but we’d also like to not talk security too. At the end of the day we’re just wanting not to be alone when we find ourselves saying "security".</p>

      <h4>Imposters Welcome</h4>

      <p>If you’re from a background which isn’t well-represented in most hacker-ish meetups, come along – we want to make a difference.</p>
      <p>If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most hacker-ish meetups, come along – we want your help making a difference.</p>
      <p>If you’re worried about not being enough of a security person, come.</p>
      <p>If you think you’re an imposter, come.</p>
      <p>If your day job isn’t security, come.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a group of experts, just people.</p>
      <p>We are interested in the social and technical problems.</p>
      <p>This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.</p>

      <h4 id="rules">The Rules</h4>

      <p>
        A code of conduct applies wherever we gather to talk security. This is true both in person and online.
      </p>

      <ul class="rules">
        <li>We think hat metaphors are asinine and that reasonable people can disagree about how to disclose vulns. We don't think that being an asshole is a prerequisite to either offense or defense work. If being one is central to your identity, this isn't the meetup for you.</li>
        <li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — security doesn't need to be a competition.</li>
        <li>Although some groups may meet in a pub, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol. Don’t question anyone’s choice of drink.</li>
        <li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them "ironically".</li>
        <li>Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
        <li>We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
        <li>We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make security more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this "has gone too far" aren’t.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We get that these rules might rub you the wrong way. We understand. There are a zillion other security meetups out there that don't have rules like this. You should check them out.</p>
